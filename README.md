# Another Eagler client in the browser

Like my other serverless client, this is 1.5.2 but this is EXPERIMENTAL and probably not supported.
There is full support for both singleplayer and multiplayer, though the latter is still in development.

This probably won't even work, just a little experiment on my part.

## Running a multiplayer server (on your machine)
1) Download this repo (the Java folder is what you need)
2) Run `run.bat` or `run_unix.sh` in both bungee and bukkit folders
3) Open the browser client
4) Connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:25565` to play on localhost

## No LAN? No problem.
If for some reason you are unable to connect between computers on your LAN network, or want to play outside of a LAN network.
